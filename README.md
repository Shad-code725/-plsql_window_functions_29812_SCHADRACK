# Airline SQL Analysis Project

## Step 1: Problem Definition

**Business Context:**  
A regional airline operates flights across multiple destinations. The company manages customer bookings, flight schedules, and ticket sales.  

**Data Challenge:**  
The airline struggles to identify which routes generate the most revenue, track passenger booking frequency, and measure growth trends over time. Without clear insights, management cannot optimize pricing, promotions, or resource allocation.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
The analysis should reveal top-performing routes, customer segmentation by travel frequency, and monthly revenue trends. These insights will guide decisions on marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and operational improvements.
